## ⚖️ General Rules

1. Be respectful. Discrimination or harassment of any kind is punishable.
2. No hacking, exploiting glitches, or using illegitimate items.
3. No chat spam (text or voice).
4. **New Life Rule:** As a civilian, upon death you lose memory of your prior life. Do not return to the exact death location or attempt to recover gear for 10 minutes or for the event duration.
5. BLUFOR, INDEP, and OPFOR must use their faction’s Discord voice channels.
6. No [metagaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming_(role-playing_games)).
7. Use typed commands (e.g., "hands up")—not everyone hears voice.
   - Use of the Shout mechanic is acceptable.
8. No cross-faction transfers of money/gear/vehicles.
9. Buildable items may only be placed to support an active or imminent RP scenario.
   Placements that block spawns, safezones, or public roads without scene-specific justification
   will be removed and may lead to action.
   - Staff may remove any placement they deem abusive.

## ⚔️ Combat Rules

1. **No RDM (Random Deathmatching):** Only kill when there is valid in-character RP and an immediate, demonstrable lethal threat (e.g., aimed weapon, firing, or imminent vehicle ramming).
2. **No Combat Logging:** Do not respawn or relog to avoid RP consequences.
3. **No fleeing to safezones:** You may not run into safezones during active combat or whilst being chased by an opposing faction.
   - A chase remains active while both sides have fired within the last **5 minutes** and remain within 500 meters.
   - If either 60 seconds pass with more than 500 meters distance or 5 minutes pass since the last shot, **safezone immunity returns**.
4. No killing or robbing in Safe Zones.
   - If you shoot from a no kill zone, you forfeit no kill zone protection for 5 minutes.
5. **No VDM (Vehicle Deathmatching):** You may only use a vehicle to kill if the target poses an immediate lethal threat (e.g., actively shooting at you or intentionally driving to ram you).
   - This refers specifically to running people over and not to vehicle weapons.
   - No kamikaze or ramming tactics with vehicles, this includes unmanned drones.
6. **Do not kill visibly unarmed players.** If a player takes clear hostile action (reaching for a hidden weapon, attempting to ram, etc) treat them as armed. 
   - Exception: collisions with ATVs/bikes that cannot reasonably defend.
7. Armed aircraft may only target civilians if directly threatened.
8. **Civilians in armed vehicles are KOS:** a vehicle is considered 'armed' if it has mounted weapons.
9. Actively robbing another faction’s convoy will make you KOS.
10. Entering enemy territory without joint ops = KOS.
11. No spawn camping. Leave at least one unobstructed spawn exit.
    Give defenders 2 full minutes after first contact before firing again inside the spawn radius.
12. Any weapon or vehicle that uses the artillery computer must be at least 1 km away from a safezone when firing. After firing, it must stay at least 1 km away for 5 minutes after the last shell has landed.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> A safezone is defined as an area with immortality.<br>
> A no-kill zone is defined as within a map area marked by a 'no-kill circle'.

---

## ⚔️ War Rules

1. Only Opfor may declare war.
   Submit a declaration to staff with the RP grievance and objectives.
   Include the intended start time and wait for staff approval.
   Announce the war in-game (/announce) before hostilities begin.
2. Civilians may not participate.
3. Minimize civilian casualties.
4. To win, capture all enemy territory points.
   Keep every enemy combatant inside a 1500 meter radius of their base for 10 consecutive minutes.
   Verification must come from staff or agreed trackers.
5. No war within the first hour of server uptime.
6. War ends in a draw if unresolved after 2 hours.
7. No land or rewards granted unless staff say otherwise.

> [!WARNING]  
> Staff have final say on Declaration/Ending of War.
---

## 🚨 Martial Law

1. Declared by staff or high-ranking Blufor.
2. Use heavy vehicles only against declared major threats.
   Examples include armored columns, mass-casualty explosives, or fortified insurgent bases.
   Log the threat and vehicle authorization in faction comms.
3. Applies to the entire North.
4. War vehicles cannot target civilians unless lethal threat.
5. End martial law once 10 minutes pass without major threat activity.
   Confirm the decision with the ranking officer or staff.
   Extensions beyond 15 minutes require a staff check-in with documented rationale.
6. Civilians can be searched without cause during martial law.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> War Vehicles include any vehicle that uses explosive ordnance or an ammo calibre higher than 12.7×99mm NATO.

> [!WARNING]  
> Staff have final say on Declaration/Ending of Martial Law.
---

## 🤝 Joint Ops

1. Declared by mutual agreement of Blufor/Opfor commanders.
   - Either side may choose to end Joint Ops.
2. Enables faction collaboration.
   - War cannot be declared whilst Joint Ops are active.
   - OPFOR cannot bring War Vehicles into the North if Martial Law is not declared.
3. Territory rules still apply: Opfor command leads the South and Blufor command leads the North.
   Notify the hosting faction before enforcing laws across the border.
4. Must be communicated to all units.
5. Cross-territory access is allowed.
6. Both factions enforce laws map-wide.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> War Vehicles include any vehicle that uses explosive ordnance or an ammo calibre higher than 12.7×99mm NATO.

> [!WARNING]  
> Staff have final say on Declaration/Ending of Joint Ops.
---

## ⚖️ Cross-Border Operations

1. Neither BLUFOR nor OPFOR may cross into the other's territory unless one of these applies.
   - Joint Operations are declared.
   - War is declared.
   - The other faction gives specific permission to cross the border for a limited purpose
     (unlike Joint Ops which is general freedom).
     - Joint Ops vehicle restrictions still apply in this scenario.
   - OPFOR OSF may cross into the North for RP-driven missions, but the entry remains illegal;
     BLUFOR may engage or detain on sight, and OSF cannot claim compensation for any losses.
2. BLUFOR Drones may not cross the border without one or more of the same conditions being met.
   OPFOR only require an RP reason.
3. Both sides may engage confirmed hostiles across the border without crossing it themselves.
   - This excludes BLUFOR firing on non-hostile players leaving the Independent Base.
   - Shooting over the border can still incur RP consequences and preferably should be done with
     permission from the other faction.
   - OPFOR cannot use War Vehicles to fire into the North if Martial Law is not declared unless the
     hostile poses a threat to your life.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> War Vehicles include any vehicle that uses explosive ordnance or an ammo calibre higher than 12.7×99mm NATO.
