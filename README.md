## ⚖️ General Rules

1. Be respectful. Discrimination or harassment of any kind is punishable.
2. No hacking, exploiting glitches, or using illegitimate items.
3. No chat spam (text or voice).

5. BLUFOR, INDEP, and OPFOR must use their faction’s Discord voice channels.
6. No [metagaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming_(role-playing_games)).

9. Use buildable items only for valid RP—no trolling.

## ⚔️ Combat Rules

1. **No RDM (Random Deathmatching):** Only kill when there is valid in-character RP and an immediate, demonstrable lethal threat (e.g., aimed weapon, firing, or imminent vehicle ramming).
2. **No Combat Logging:** Do not respawn or relog to avoid RP consequences.
3. **No fleeing to safezones:** You may not run into safezones during active combat or whilst being chased by an opposing faction.
   - Active Combat / Active Chase is defined as firing or being fired upon or being within immediate range (up to 500m) of your opponent in the last 5 minutes.
4. No killing or robbing in Safe Zones.
   - If you shoot from a no kill zone, you forfeit no kill zone protection for 5 minutes.
5. **No VDM (Vehicle Deathmatching):** You may only use a vehicle to kill if the target poses an immediate lethal threat (e.g., actively shooting at you or intentionally driving to ram you).
   - This refers specifically to running people over and not to vehicle weapons.
   - No kamikaze or ramming tactics with vehicles, this includes unmanned drones.
6. **Do not kill visibly unarmed players.** If a player takes clear hostile action (reaching for a hidden weapon, attempting to ram, etc) treat them as armed. 
   - Exception: collisions with ATVs/bikes that cannot reasonably defend.
7. Armed helicopters may only target civilians if threatened.
8. **Civilians in armed vehicles are KOS:** a vehicle is considered 'armed' if it has mounted weapons.
9. Actively robbing another faction’s convoy will make you KOS.
10. Entering enemy territory without joint ops = KOS.
11. No spawn camping; allow exit routes (leave at least one clear path and reasonable time for players to exit spawn).
12. Any weapon or vehicle that uses the artillery computer must be at least 1 km away from a safezone when firing. After firing, it must stay at least 1 km away for 5 minutes after the last shell has landed.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> A safezone is defined as an area with immortality.<br>
> A no-kill zone is defined as within a map area marked by a 'no-kill circle'.

2. Civilians may not participate.
3. Minimize civilian casualties.
4. To win: Capture all enemy territory points and contain them within 1500m of their base for 10 minutes.
5. No war within the first hour of server uptime.
6. War ends in a draw if unresolved after 2 hours.
7. No land or rewards granted unless staff say otherwise.

## ⚖️ Cross-Border Operations

1. Neither BLUFOR nor OPFOR may be in the territory of the other faction unless one or more of the following conditions are met.
   - Joint Operations are declared.
   - War is declared.
   - The other faction gives specific permission to cross the border for a limited purpose (unlike Joint Ops which is general freedom)
     - Joint Ops Rule 10 still applies in this scenario
   - OPFOR OSF are excluded from this rule so long as they have an RP reason, but it is still illegal and they may be engaged by BLUFOR in the North.
2. BLUFOR Drones may not be sent across the border without one or more of the same conditions being met. OPFOR only require an RP reason.
3. Both sides can engage known **and confirmed** hostiles who are on the other side of the border, so long as they do not cross the border to do so.
   - This does not include BLUFOR firing on people leaving the Independent Base who have not expressed hostile action.
   - Shooting over the border can still incur RP consequences and preferably should be done with permission from the other faction.
   - OPFOR cannot use War Vehicles to fire into the North if Martial Law is not declared unless the hostile poses a threat to your life.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> War Vehicles include any vehicle that uses explosive ordinance or an ammo calibre higher than 12.7×99mm NATO.
