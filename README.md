## ⚖️ General Rules

1. Be respectful. Discrimination or harassment of any kind is punishable.
2. No hacking, exploiting glitches, or using illegitimate items.
3. No chat spam (text or voice).
4. **No RDM (Random Deathmatching):** Only kill when there is valid in-character RP and an immediate, demonstrable lethal threat (e.g., aimed weapon, firing, or imminent vehicle ramming).
5. **New Life Rule:** As a civilian, upon death you lose memory of your prior life. Do not return to the exact death location or attempt to recover gear for 10 minutes or for the event duration.
6. BLUFOR, INDEP, and OPFOR must use their faction’s Discord voice channels.
7. **No Combat Logging:** Do not respawn or relog to avoid RP consequences.
8. No [metagaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming_(role-playing_games)).
9. Use typed commands (e.g., "hands up")—not everyone hears voice.
10. No killing or robbing in Safe Zones.
11. **No VDM (Vehicle Deathmatching):** You may only use a vehicle to kill if the target poses an immediate lethal threat (e.g., actively shooting at you or intentionally driving to ram you).
12. Do not kill visibly unarmed players. If a player takes clear hostile action (reaching for a hidden weapon, attempting to ram, etc) treat them as armed. Exception: collisions with ATVs/bikes that cannot reasonably defend.
13. Armed helicopters may only target civilians if threatened.
14. Civilians in armed vehicles are KOS: a vehicle is considered 'armed' if it has mounted weapons.
15. No kamikaze or ramming tactics with vehicles, this includes unmanned drones.
16. Actively robbing another faction’s convoy will make you KOS.
17. Entering enemy territory without joint ops = KOS.
18. No cross-faction transfers of money/gear/vehicles.
19. No spawn camping; allow exit routes (leave at least one clear path and reasonable time for players to exit spawn).
20. Use buildable items only for valid RP—no trolling.
